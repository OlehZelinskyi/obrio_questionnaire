## Getting Started

You can run this program in two modes.
But first of all you need to install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

In this project React 19 is used and some of the packages probably don't fully support it yet

In case if you see any errors during the installation try to use the following command:

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Development Mode

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Production Mode

```bash
npm run build && npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
